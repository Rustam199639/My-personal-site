      <h1>My hobbies:</h1>
      <p>So from school  I liked to play guitar, but I found to my self it boring(sorry if you guitar player).</p>
      <p>and one day I just was so excited from some Bass guitar players, that really inspired me to move </p>
      <p>that way. And I liked to play(jam) with some good musicians and thought about like career maybe.</p>
      <p>But one day I found to my self Coding.. that was much better and interesting that blew my mind.</p>
      <p>I am joking. Actually I really like music and all kind of instruments, and more in that I like </p>
      <p>interaction part of being together and play. Also I do sport, like bicycle riding and bars(workout)</p>
      <p> and really enjoing of creating and working on code parts in our degree. I love yoga, and learn about</p>
      <p>it in sacred scriptures, like Bhagavat Gita, and sometimes play double bass :)</p>
